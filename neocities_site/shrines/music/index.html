                    <p>I've been listening to my goth playlist again recently (not actually MY playlist but i luv it, Goth Playlist for Baby Bats from Alienpuke!) and stumbled on this gem. Super catchy, and makes me want to MOVE!! Very nice SAX!!! I'll definitely be checking out the band's other music later, starting with this album very soon!

                    <p>While working, I found this ethereal song listening to Cocteau Twins' music on shuffle. Hitherto has this melody that makes me want to dance in my kitchen at 2 am with a wine bottle as my partner, the haunting vocals making me yearn for something unknown, something common in Cacteau Twins music for me. Some other mentionable songs I've heard from them recently include Love's Easy Tears, Serpentskirt, and Half-Gifts.
