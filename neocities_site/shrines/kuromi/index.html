            I've had a subtle obsession with Kuromi 2022. I've always loved Sanrio since watching Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theatre as a kid, and playing DSI games Loving Life with Hello Kitty and Friends and Hello Kitty Party. I had seen Kuromi before 2022, but I ran into a Kuromi beanie at Hot Topic early that year and impulsively bought it. That started my collection. I don't have a massive collection or anything, since I frown upon too many useless items, but I love the items I do own!. From the top of my head, these are the Kuromi items I have: a mousepad, a faux stained glass piece, a small neon light, shirts, earrings, blankets, a poster, a pillow, and a few other trinkets floating around my house. Maybe eventually I'll post pictures of some of these items, because I do cherish them.

            I love that her color palette varies, from being purple based to grey/black and pink and I think her personality is cute and mischevious. Although I absolutely adore this character, I don't personally relate to her too much, I just love her design, which is enough for me!
